=== LOL Any ===

A there-exists quantifier in LOL enumerates the type of the parameter.

You can use `any` or `∃`.

For example:

  any i : I { lift(i == i) }            has the type `nu(1)`
  any i : I { lift(i != i) }            has the type `un(0)`

Here, the type `I` is enumerated.
`nu(1)` means that the inner expression is true for at least one case.
`un(0)` means that the inner expression is false for all cases.

Another example:

  ∃ i : (I ~= I) { lift(i == i) }     has the type `nu(1 ~= 1)`

Here, the type `I ~= I` is enumerated.
`un(1 ~= 1)` means that the inner expression is true for at least one case,
but in a one-dimensional sense, since `I ~= I` is a path.
