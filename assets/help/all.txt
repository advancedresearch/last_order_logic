=== LOL All ===

A for-all quantifier in LOL enumerates the type of the parameter.

You can use `all` or `∀`.

For example:

  all i : I { lift(i == i) }            has the type `un(1)`
  all i : I { lift(i != i) }            has the type `nu(0)`

Here, the type `I` is enumerated.
`un(1)` means that the inner expression is true for all cases.
`nu(0)` means that the inner expression is false for at least one case.

Another example:

  ∀ i : (I ~= I) { lift(i == i) }     has the type `un(1 ~= 1)`

Here, the type `I ~= I` is enumerated.
`un(1 ~= 1)` means that the inner expression is true for all cases,
but in a one-dimensional sense, since `I ~= I` is a path.
